# Definitions for the default heating values supported by the package.
# Each heating value is defined as an independent dimension.
# This way, pint allows for operations like division or multiplication,
# and at the same time prevents incompatible operations on these dimensions.
#
# See also: https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/defining.html


# Format:
# <heating_value_name> = [<heating_value_name>] [= <alias>]

lower_heating_value = [lower_heating_value] = LHV = NCV = net_calorific_value
higher_heating_value = [higher_heating_value] = HHV = GCV = gross_calorific_value
